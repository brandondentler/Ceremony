        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p class="indent"> 
                During the Spring 2020 semester, my team worked with DonateEquity on a project as part of our Experience Studio course at Purdue University.<b class="bold"> We were initially tasked to create a tool that would enable university fundraising officers to quickly identify potential donors to solicit major gifts from. Our research findings led us to shift our focus instead towards helping officers build close and lasting relationships with their regular donors. </b> 
            </p>

        <h4> My Role </h4>
            <p class="indent"> 
                I co-led a team of seven UX Design students and worked closely with our sponsor, Landon Young. <b class="bold"> I was responsible for conducting interviews, synthesizing findings from stakeholders, and designing the wireframes for our finalized concept. </b> As a team lead, I mentored and delegated tasks to first-year students throughout the course of the semester as well as guided the overall direction of the project. 
            </p>
  
        <h4> The Problem </h4>
            <p class="indent"> 
                University donation officers struggle to efficiently navigate and input information into the mobile CRM app when they're constantly on the move during business trips. Additionally, with a tight schedule, they also finds it difficult to fit in time for impromptu meetings with donors.
            </p>

        <h4> The Solution </h4>
        <p class="indent"> 
            <b class="bold"> Affinity: a cloud-based database and app integrated with the university’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Affinity allows efficient creation and retrieval of contact reports as well as flexible meeting scheduling. </b> By using Affinity, donation officers are able to direct their energy towards getting to know patrons instead of worrying about the logistics of their job.
        </p>

<!--RESEARCH-->
    <div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
        <p class="indent">
            To begin, our team conducted several interviews with administrators from various university alumni associations. Initially, we were under the impression that alumni officers were the ones soliciting donations. We soon learned that many universities have two, separate offices for alumni engagement and university development. </p>
            
        <p class="indent"> 
            From this realization we then conducted eight interviews with development officers, three of which were in-person interviews with officers working at Purdue. Our goal was to understand the role of a development officer and find pain points areas where their workflows could be improved.
        </p>

    <h4> Participants</h4>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li> Senior Director of Development, College of Engineering, Purdue </li>
        <li> Chief Development Officer, Polytechnic Institute, Purdue </li>
        <li> Senior Director of Development, College of Agriculture, Purdue </li>
        <li> Development Operations Manager, Williams University </li>
        <li> Director of Donor Relations and Stewardship, Trine University </li>
        <li> Senior Development Officer, Williams University </li>
        <li> Entrepreneurial Management student, Ball State University</li>
        <li> Executive Vice President, DonorSearch </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="indent"> 
        After our interviews, we identified the common themes we heard from our participants. Our most significant and unexpected takeaway was that development officers do not have a problem finding new leads / prospects with their existing resources (internet and university archives). Instead, we found that fostering relationships and building trust with current donors was more important. Since officers represent the university, much of their work is dedicated toward in-person visits with donors. This led us to realign our problem scope to focus on managing these interpersonal connections through emphasis on details obtained from in-person interactions.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent">
        In addition to interviews, we engaged in other research methods. These included examining online resources, analyzing findings through multiple affinity diagrams, and reviewing existing solutions for development officers (mainly CRMs). The activities were done concurrently with our interviews and helped us have productive conversations with our participants.

        <h2> SCOPING AND IDEATION </h2>

    <div class="w3-padding-64">
        <div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
            <h4> Spreadsheet </h4>
                <p class="indent">
                    we created a spreadsheet to reflect what we had learned from our interviews. Each team member reviewed one interview’s audio recording and written notes. In the spreadsheet, we wrote out each interviewee’s pain points, current solutions, and ideas to address said pain points.
                </p>

                <p class="indent"> 
                    The spreadsheet opened up potential opportunities we could take towards creating a solution that would address our user’s needs. After discussion, we listed different functionalities we wanted to prioritize with the tool:
                </p>

        <ol class="indent">
            <li> Mobile app for creation and management of contact reports </li>
            <li> Map function to search donor location</li>
            <li> Contact list app that tracks interests, birthdays, location, etc. </li>
            <li> App that links between calendar and other apps to plan meetings</li>
        </ol>

            <img src="/images/affinity-sketch2.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%; margin-top: 5%;">
        </div>

            <p class="indent"> 
                In the end, we decided that our solution would be in the form of a mobile application integrated with the university’s CRM. Because development officers are not always in a position to pull out their laptop and write down notes after each donor meeting, we saw value in convenience. The two main features we prioritized were: </b>
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li> Contact report drafting and organization – an easily scannable list of previous trips an officer has taken (sorted from most recent to least recent), along with their respective reports on each of the donors visited. </li>
                <li> Donor tracker – a map depicting the number of donors in a development officer’s portfolio residing in a particular area. The larger the amount of donors living in one city, the bigger the representation on the map. This was done in order to assist officers in seeing who else they could meet up with in an area. </li>
            </ol>

            <h4> Site Map </h4>

            <p class="indent"> 
                A site map was created for the purpose of communicating the different functions we wanted to prioritize within the mobile experience for our stakeholders. Since we were paring down the CRM to include only those features interacted with during business trips, we organized the flow by primary versus secondary screens.

    <h4> Testing</h4>
        <p class="indent"> 
            In order to better understand if officers would find this app useful for their responsibilities at work as well as evaluate the overall concept, we conducted usability testing through screen sharing on video calls. Unfortunately, our current situation could not allow us to truly simulate their work environment but the feedback we received informed our iterations.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            For testing, we followed up with several of our interviewees from earlier and used an unstructured approach in which we gave them control of our screen to explore the prototypes. First, we had them think back to their last trip visiting donors and use their experience to guide their understanding of our solution. Then we had participants view a set of screens and explain to us their initial perceptions of the tool in the context of their own experience.
        </p>

        <h5> Findings </h5>

    <ul> 
<li> In a donor profile, they would like to see the donor’s preferred mode of communication, what date the last gift was given, and the city a donor is from to help with organization. </li>
<li> Since donors can move both forwards and backwards in the life cycle, there should be a more dynamic option for selecting what part of the cycle a donor is in.</li>
<li> It would be useful to see unmanaged donors on the map so that the officer could reach out to someone new if they find themselves in the area. </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"> 
    Through testing we confirmed that Affinity would most likely have a place during the scheduling process and directly after donor meetings. We also found that the ability to add quick notes directly after a meeting helped development officers organize their thoughts before submitting it into their CRM.

                This project was a great learning experience for me. Through it all, I had to master the art of adapting: to my role as a team lead, to the dramatic rescoping of our project, and finally, the transition from in-person to remote collaboration. Despite the challenges, we were able to gain experience with conducting extensive research and truly empathize with our user group.

                In terms of future considerations, we would have liked to explore the relationship between a university’s alumni engagement office and development office. Since the two have an overlapping user base (as the majority of donors tend to be alumni), it would be fascinating to identify ways we could leverage the two to maximize the size of donations universities receive. While we didn’t pursue this area of focus due to time constraints, we made sure that our sponsor was aware of the different possibilities Affinity could take in the future.
