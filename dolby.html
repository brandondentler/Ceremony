        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p class="indent"> 
                During the Fall 2020 semester, my team worked with Dolby on a project as part of our Experience Studio course at Purdue University. We were initially tasked to create a new tool that enabled gamers to use Dolby's Atmos sound program with ease. After a long research stage, the team found that <b class="bold"> creating a digital sound mixer widget through Windows Game bar would provide one central hub for sound settings and customization that has community capabilities for instant sharing and use as well as having easy user adoption to the widget. </b> 
            </p>

        <h4> My Role </h4>
            <p class="indent"> 
                I co-led a team of six UX Design students and worked closely with multiple sponsors on the Dolby team. <b class="bold"> I was responsible for conducting interviews, synthesizing findings from stakeholders, and designing the wireframes for our finalized concept. </b> As a team lead, I mentored and delegated tasks to first-year students throughout the course of the semester as well as guided the overall direction of the project. 
            </p>
  
        <h4> COVID Pandemic </h4>
            <p class="indent"> 
                Our design opportunity for this semester was to focus on the impact of COVID on gamers. The social environment is essential in gaming. And because of COVID, this environment has been impacted on a personal level as well as the entirety of the gaming community. As a team, we found an opportunity to focus on community support in a time where people are isolating at an unprecedented level. As the semester continued, our user group narrowed further.

<!--PROJECT SUMMARY-->
    <div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
        <p class="indent">
            Our first plan of action was to narrow our problem scope through literature reviews relevant to our problem space. We hoped to have a better understanding of this space, and possibly identify some surface-level traits that gamers have. <b class="bold"> The areas identified through the literature review were: </b>
        </p>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li> Types of Gamers </li>
        <li> Headphone Usage </li>
        <li> Sound Softwares </li>
        <li> Video Game Market </li>
        <li> COVID-19 Effects </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="indent"> 
        From this, we learned a few things: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Gamer types are not on a linear spectrum from casual to competitive, but are characterized by their behaviors. </li>
        <li> Surround sound is especially crucial for competitive games. </li> 
        <li> Online gaming activity is on the rise following the pandemic. </li>
        <li> Having a social aspect is important for many gamers. </li>
    </ol>

    <h4> Survey </h4>
        <p class="indent"> 
            When we realized that gamers could be categorized with behaviors, we wanted a way to identify those behaviors and design around our findings. We figured the best way to do this was though a survey, as it would help us solidify types of gamers with raw data. We created a google survey that sought out to find these gamer behaviors so that we could categorize and design around them. We sent this survey through reddit, discord, and our peers, and ended up with 239 responses.

            “Though I do try to play with friends when I can because it's been really fun.”

    <div class="w3-padding-32">
        <h4> My Role</h4>
            <p class="indent"> 
                To gain some more insights into those who took the survey, we conducted 18 interviews from the survey respondants. <b class="bold"> We wanted to gain insight from gamers’ first-hand experiences with an emphasis on gaming behaviors and sound experiences. </b>
                <br>
                From this, we learned of 6 categories of behaviors, seen below.
            </p>

    <div class="w3-center">

        <p class="indent"> 
            Our main insights included:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="indent">
            <li> <b class="bold"> Gaming is an emotional experience </b> </li>
            <li> <b class="bold"> Gamers are influenced by their friends’ behaviors </b> </li>
            <li> <b class="bold"> Multiplayer PC gaming has the most opportunity for innovation </b> </li>

            <h4> Problem Framing </h4>
                <h5 class="indent" style="text-align: center;"> 
                    <b class="bold"> PC gamers </b> playing online games with their friends need a way to <b class="bold"> balance </b> the core audio inputs so that they can customize the gaming experience to their <b class="bold">sound preferences. </b> 
                </h5>

        <ol class="indent">
            <li> We picked <b class="bold">PC gamers </b> as these made up a majority of our interview & survey respondents who reported behavior changes </li>
            <li> We focused on <b class="bold">balancing audio </b> inputs because this was the biggest frustration among the gamers we talked to</li>
            <li> Our research made it clear to us that each gamer has their own <b class="bold"> unique preferences </b> to how they want to set their sound levels while gaming, depending on factors like type of video game or number of players </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4> Carousal Sketching </h4>
            <p class="indent"> 
                Upon review of previous individual sketches and sponsor clarification and guidance, we moved into <b class="bold"> rounds of collaborative sketching. </b>
            </p>

        <div class="w3-center">
            <img src="./images/dolbycarousal.jpg" style="width: 75%; height: 75%;">

            <figcaption style="text-align: center;"> 
                This current sketch is highlighted in particular because there are a few key features we brought towards our final concepts. To summarize this sketch, some of the important features include ability to adjust individual sound inputs, quick way to open the sound board, and a sound mixing overlay where we could adjust game sound and have presets. 
            </figcaption>
    
            <p class="indent"> 
                Other sketching themes that were highlighted during this sketching session include: 
            </p>
            <ul class="indent">
                <li> Sound Sliders </li>
                <li> Presets </li>
                <li> Internal and External Sounds </li>
                <li> Digital Sound Mixer </li>
                <li> Physical Sound Board </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> Concept Package </h4>

            <p class="indent"> 
                After presenting our carosual sketches to the sponsors, we found it best that our next step would be a concept package to be sent to the Dolby design team. For this concept package, we wanted to generate 6 different concepts with no constraints. We wanted them to be blue-sky ideas that were focused on immediate solutions, short-term, and long-term. 
            </p>

    <div class="w3-center">
        <img src="./images/dolbysketches.jpg" style="width: 75%; height: 75%;">
    </div>
    <p class="indent"> 
        Concepts generated are as follows (starting at top left):
    </p>
        <ol class="indent">
            <li> Audio and Visual Effects</li>
            <li> Digital Sound Mixer Overlay </li>
            <li> Sound Gloves </li>
            <li> DIY Physical Sound Board </li>
            <li> Gaming Voice Assistant </li>
            <li> Ambisonic Dome </li>
        </ol>

        <h5 class="bold" style="text-align: center;">
            As a team, as well as the Dolby Design team, we took a vote to which concept we should move forward with. The Digital Sound Mixer Overlay was the majority vote and from here we were to narrow our ideation to that concept.
