<!-- DESIGN OPPURTUNITY -->
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
  
    <h2>Design Oppurtunity</h2>
        <p class="indent"> As the world evolves to future immersion technology, how can people experience these technologies in new ways without leaving the comfort of their own home? VR has the opportunity to evolve how TV and entertainment is viewed. Rather than sitting on the couch and watching what is being broadcasted, how can this experience be enhanced and personalized to the viewer? VR technology allows for people to feel like they are in the event and participating and can even bring new social interactions that wouldn’t happen otherwise. 
        </p>

    <h2> The Solution </h2>
        <p class="indent"> Bring VR technology into TV to allow their users to feel like they are attending a sporting event and can have a social experience from the comfort of their own home. I want to design a VR prototype that combines the VR experience and a live sporting event where the viewer is “sitting in the stands” surrounded by other VR members, family, friends, or strangers. 
        </p>
  
    <h2> Learning Objectives </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> 
                Analyze VR technologies and how it can fit within a live streaming service 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Demonstrate the many applications of VR technology merged with Live TV through storyboarding 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Create Personas based on the type of users found in research and storyboarding accompanied with a service blueprint/journey map to illustrate those persona’s interaction between VR and TV. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Produce numerous rapid sketching sessions to inform new insights and generated concepts 
            </li>

            Because of the COVID pandemic, Jason and mark haven’t attended a football game in over a year, and they have been left to sit on the couch and watch at home. 
            <br>
            Both of them have grown very tired of this and often communicate to each other through a phone call during the game. They wish there was a solution for them to still enjoy the in-person feeling while still being within the safety of their own home.

<!--PROJECT SUMMARY-->
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
    <p class="indent">
        I had a wonderful time with this project. I enjoyed the independence and letting myself reach outside the bounds of what I was used to. At the beginning of this project, I wasn’t expecting it to be as research-heavy as it was but I thought it best to completely understand the space and create some concepts to back up the research I conducted.
        <br><br>
        Although I struggled with the project’s identity after the research phase, I had a lot of help from my peers and professors that allowed me to better see where I wanted this project to end. Making the decision to create a cross-channel experience greatly impacted the meaningfulness of the end product in a positive way. Although this decision was not made until the very end, I am still very happy with what I produced.
        <br><br>
        For future development of this project, I would like to focus on the actual VR experience rather than the planning stages. Because of the short time frame, I had to focus on only one of the two.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I very much enjoyed this project and am very happy with what I produced. It allowed me to see that I enjoy the research-side of UX much more than I thought and that although I worked alone on this project, I can manage my time very well and mitigate stress much better.
