                                During the Fall 2019 semester, my team and I had the opportunity to work on a project sponsored by UEGroup and Ford Motor Company as student collaborators for Purdue University's Experience Studio. We identified a section of FordPass, a mobile car application, that would enable it to capture or recreate a positive feeling that we experience when using our favorite app.
                                
                            </p>
                            <p> FordPass is Ford's "all in one" mobile car application that allows users to monitor and control their vehicle. Several features include lock and unlock, remote start, map of nearby locations, vehicle details, schedule start, and schedule maintenance.

                            <p>I was part of a team of six UX Design students. I helped our team familiarize ourselves
                                on topics relevant to our project through extensive online research, including studying current user thoughts on FORDPass and problem areas with their exisiting
                                solutions. In doing so, I established the finalized problem statement approved
                                by sponsors as well as built a persona that accurately reflected the needs of our user
                                group. I also played a big part in the project idea and wireframes.

                                After our final scope, our goal was to redesign the home screen for the users we found during research throughout. We are redesigning the home page for a user group of middle-aged car owners. </p>

                            <figcaption>In essence, this is a graphic model to display the users’ emotions toward a product or a brand and its capabilities. In creating this device, we sought to guide our research and ideation along the design process with a core set of untouchable values. This way, we have a perfect reference for our sketches in the future that will help us maintain an aligned focus on the user.

                            <p> This is a research technique that is used in early stages of understanding a concept and what exactly we are designing for. As this is a very unknown stage of the design process, this model serves as a representation of our user base’s deepest desires for the product. Users might ask, “What can I do with this thing? How can it improve my life? How will it make me feel? Will I continue using it?” The answers to these questions are the ideas that guide this model.</p>
                            
                            <p> After learning how to properly build the characteristics model, it became time for us to create one for own. With what we came up with, we have been able to understand our conceptual implementation for FordPass through a lens that directs and guides our imagined features, interactions, visual presentations, and technical interactions. Everything we design can be referenced back to this model two ensure that what we come up with down the line will still be aligned properly towards the ideals that we value, and then, as a result, our implemented designs will be successful tuned to apps that inspire us, so that FordPass in turn will benefit.</p> <br>

Over all apps that we analyzed, these values were consistently repeated. So, moving forward, control and organization allow a user to feel “Relaxed, Powerful, & Effective.” This is the emotional cues layer, which are the reactions a user gains from an experience. Lastly, there is the layer of product cues, which inspire the emotional reactions. This is where a user can unlock their car, find the car’s parking spot, and know the car’s health. In total, the model reads as,<br><br>

                                <p>With advice from our sponsor to save ideation for when we felt we really had the knowledge and understanding of the app and its users, we conducted several rounds of ideation after conducing our extensive forms of research. From starting off broad, to focusing our ideation on the insights found from research, we were able to feel confident that what we were designing truly fit the needs of our users.</p>

                                <p> When initially sketching, we wanted to apply our knowledge gained from research and generate a multitude of different ideas. Each member was tasked with sketching 8-10 different ideas. After presenting them, we had a better understanding of where we wanted to go. </p>

                                  <p style="margin-top: 5%;">   After generating multiple ideas, we singled out the features we liked most. Some of those include: <br><br>
                                    • Scheduled Start <br>
                                    • Climate Control <br>
                                    • Lock, Unlock, Start Engine (centered) <br><br>
                                        We chose some of our favorite sketches and presented them during a sponsor meeting to get a better understanding of where we were at and if we were on the right track. After that meeting we did further ideation and sketching,</p>

                                <p> As a team, we started to feel confident with our ideas and what we were generating. After gaining all of the knowledge and ideas generated in the past rounds of sketching, we had a general idea of what we wanted to do. We were to generate another 8-10 sketches. From here, we would again find our favorite ideas and create a frankensketch.</p>

                                <p> Our frankensketch (which is a consolidated mashup of everyone’s ideas) includes a representation of what we thought as a group needed to be included in a redesign for the homepage. We created this sketch to help us create lo-fidelity mockups with a consistent layout, but with different ways of displaying the features. The pages generated can be seen on the next slide. </p>

                                This project has been very different from others I have done. I learned how to deal with many scope shifts and learned how to look at design through emotion. The project contained many different layers and phases. Dealing with chaos and uncertainty, and understanding how to keep moving forward, exploring and creating in the midst of ambiguity was a vital experience. I quite enjoyed the creation of our desirability model. Knowing that I was working towards evoking a certain emotion in our user group generated a focus in my ideation. This project taught us to be more flexible and adaptable. It was difficult to think about pivoting halfway into the semester, but we were able to gain a new learning experience.
